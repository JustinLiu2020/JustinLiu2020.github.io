        <h1>This is the Justin Liu website!</h1>
        <p>Some things you can do are : <a href = "book.html">Reading my horrible book WIP</a>, <a>looking at some things about me,</a> <a>a blog</a>, <a href = "notes_index.html">and some class notes that you can copy.</a> I write down these notes as I learn, and there will be a different webpage for different subjects. <a>I will also write some ideas down.</a><a>I will also have a timetable here.</a><a>There's a project I've been wanting to work on for aaaaaaaaaaaaaages : Project Byte.</a>.<br> Basically, it is a project on Minecraft Java Edition (Or bedrock. We can hold a vote if you like.) where we want to make a computer using redstone ONLY. No redstone experience is required, but we would most certainly welcome an expert.</p>
