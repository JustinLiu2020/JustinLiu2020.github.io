        <h1>Math notes that you can copy!</h1>
            <p>
                Pythagorean theorem : aˆ2 + bˆ2 = cˆ2. Kinda boring, but it's a start. <br>
                Quadratic formula : x = (-b +- sqrt(bˆ2 - 4ac)) / 2a. This one is a bit more interesting.<br>
                Cubic formula : x = (-b +- (bˆ2 - 4ac)ˆ(1/2)) / 2a. This one is even more interesting.<br>
                Quartic formula : x = (-b +- sqrt(bˆ2 - 4ac)) / 2a. This one is even more interesting, but it's starting to get insane.<br>
                Anything higher than that : I'm not even going to bother.<br>
                Fine. It's impossible. There is no formula for anything higher than a quartic. <br>
                Here are some more math notes. <br>
                1 + 1 = 2. <br>
                What? That's simple, right!
                Fine, here's a harder one. <br>
                3x + 5 = 20. <br>
                3x = 20 - 5. <br>
                3x = 15. <br>
                x = 15 / 3. <br>
                x = 5. <br>
                There. That's better. <br>
                That's how you do algebra. <br>
                Now onto calculus! <br>
                I recommend you go on <a href = "https://khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> or <a href = "https://mathsisfun/calculus/index.html">Mathsisfun</a> for this. They're both great learning websites for maths!<br>
