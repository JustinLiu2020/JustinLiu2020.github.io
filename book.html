    <p>It was quite a picturesque afternoon, with a non-picturesque evening. I was sitting in my room, staring at the ceiling. There was nothing else to stare at. There were no windows, and the only entertainment I had were books called What if, How to, and What if 2 and a bed that felt like rock. The floor was pretty hard, since it was made of steel. I wanted to blow up the building and escape, but I knew I would die in the process. My entire life was suffering. Endless suffering. Suffering one after another. It is a horrible feeling. The only way I could get food was when my Dad slipped some food into my room. Only my dad cares about me. Everyone else loathes me. I have always felt so lonely, like a candle in a cold dark cave. My father was a computer scientist. He discovered a way to 3d print DNA when I was 7. When Kilobyte bought him, he found out that he was cheated. My mother died after this. Died of “food poisoning”. The blood on her chest said otherwise. Ever since that incident, they shut me on my quaint little floor No. -17 (Everyone in the company, children or parent or adult and every subdivision of humans, had a whole floor to themselves), afraid I might find out how my mother died. The only time I ever felt the day of light since then was in the hospital 5 miles away when my heart stopped beating. I’ve tried to escape and see the sun. I’ve always failed. Every attempt, every trick. Advice to those who want to escape : don’t sneak out. Sneak out, and halfway through, when you're about to crack, bust out. That was what I tried again this evening.</p>

This was where the fun began. I was staring up at my ceiling as usual, when I put my plan into action. I got out my lockpicking set, my homemade walkie-talkie, and a torch. My plan was simple. I'd go to my friend Ezra, who lived on floor No. -16.5, and go out together, picking the floor locks, and shining a torch in the guard's eye's on the -5th floor, before kicking him in the shins and dunking him in a bin. This would not go down well with my parents, and I was ashamed to do it, as I <em>was</em> an honest boy, but now, things would have to change, but I will change back to my normal self, right?</p>
